What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git is created to track changes and manage version control.  You do it when you want to start version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows a developer to get things ready to commit and then do a double check of everything in the repository before executing the commit.  This could prevent unwanted commits that omit files.
