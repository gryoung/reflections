The diff helped me find which line was an issue so I could 
investigate further.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It could help identify where a bug occurred.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: limits the amount of history to wade through to find meaningful changes
Cons: You may forget to commit at the proper time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Some file types logically go together and would make sense to save together in one commit.  In others, like Google docs, it is unlikely that different files would work together in a meaningful way, plus saving is happening much too frequently on each individual document for multiple file savings to make much sense.
